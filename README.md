# DISPROPORTIONATE ARRESTS ON BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS

### by Joshua Nguyen

## Overview

This app was created for Chase Romano's Visual Analytics Course in the Data Science and Business Analytics Master's Program at UNC Charlotte. The goal of this app was to visualize the disproportionate arrests made on Black and Brown individuals. This is shown using data from two cities: Fayetteville, NC and New Orleans, LA from 2020-2022.

## Future Plans
This project didn't allow me to go into *as* much depth as I would've liked to, so in the future (if I find a place to host my app with more storage) I would like to delve deeper into the systemic issues presented in this project. I would also include the ability to compare more cities with differing demographics. I think the important thing with this type of project is to show the patterns and how they show up in any kind of city.

I would hope that my work inspires those to always be curious and question everything. The world isn't black and white in the slightest, but a nuanced and deep gray color, so always do your research and city your sources!! :>
