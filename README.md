# DISPROPORTIONATE ARRESTS ON BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS

### by Joshua Nguyen

## Overview

This app was created for Chase Romano's Visual Analytics Course in the Data Science and Business Analytics Master's Program at UNC Charlotte. The goal of this app was to visualize the disproportionate arrests made on Black and Brown individuals. This is shown using data from two cities: Fayetteville, NC and New Orleans, LA from 2020-2022.
